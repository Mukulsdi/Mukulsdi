My name is Mukul Moudgil. 
I am thirteen years old. 
I study in S.D. International School. 
I have a deep interest in the English language; and that interest ignited my love for reading, which led me to writing my own book- 'The Locket of Time: A Twist of Fate'. My book's second part- 'The Locket of Time: Bonds Unveiled' was published- like my first book- on Notion Press. 
Recently, I wrote another book- 'Pantheon', which is a collection of short stories from Hindu Mythology, and it will be released on Amazon on 10th of June. 
In my leisure time, I love to read books & Coding. 
Some of my favorite genres are fantasy, thriller, and historical fiction. 
I also love playing indoor games like carrom, ludo, and chess. My interest in coding is growing. 
I am learning coding in school and have been enjoying the process immensely. I have started working on small projects to apply what I learn and further develop my skills.
My goal is to become proficient in multiple programming languages and contribute to exciting projects in the future.
